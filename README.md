# pyCiscoPrime
Python API Wrapper for Cisco Prime API

Based on the [Cisco Prime REST API](https://developer.cisco.com/site/prime-infrastructure/documents/api-reference/rest-api-v3-6/v4/@_docs/). This is a Python wrapper built using the Requests library. There is very minimal functionality baked into this. I don't make a ton of use of our Cisco Prime appliance, and that's only decreasing over time. 

Take a read through the REST API documentation linked above. This should be enough for you to build additional functionality for the appliance where required.
